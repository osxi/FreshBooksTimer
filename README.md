Track development on Trello: [FreshBooks Timer Board](https://trello.com/b/VlS3lADH)

## Description:

A chrome extension for tracking time with FreshBooks through their API.

It allows you to track time and submit it through a browser action button. If
you open it while on a Trello card it will prepopulate the notes with the title
of the card. Since I use Trello that is what I will be focusing on, but if
someone wants to provide a similar feature on another project management tool
that's completely welcome.

It relies on a rails proxy to the FreshBooks API which prevents me from having
to mess with their xml api directly. It's running on a free Heroku instance and
it's also open source and can be found
